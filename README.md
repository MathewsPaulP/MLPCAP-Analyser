# MLPCAP-Analyser
Novel Python framework deploying machine learning algorithms for detecting malicious network packets generated by viruses. The idea behind this project was to create a supervised machine learning solution that learns from an infected PCAP and identifies threats in an unseen PCAP. 

This script takes in a pcap file that has been processed using wireshark identifying the malicious data packets. The pcap file is converted to binary for faster processing and ran through ml algorithms from sci-kit learn. The original infected pcap dataset and related files were obtained from https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/
